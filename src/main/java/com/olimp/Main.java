/**
 * Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns an array of the top-3
 * most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII.
 * (No need to handle fancy punctuation.)
 * Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
 * Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
 * If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty
 * array if a text contains no words.
 * Examples:
 * top_3_words("In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
 * mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
 * in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
 * coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
 * nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
 * on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.")
 * # => ["a", "of", "on"]
 *
 * top_3_words("e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e")
 * # => ["e", "ddd", "aa"]
 *
 * top_3_words("  //wont won't won't")
 * # => ["won't", "wont"]
